# OPERATORS

# 1. Arithmetic Operators	            + - * / % ** //	Math operations
# 2. Assignment Operators	            = += -= *= /=	Assigning values to variables
# 3. Comparison Operators	            == != > < >= <=	Compare values, return True/False
# 4. Logical Operators	                'and' 'or' 'not'	Combine conditions
# 5. Identity Operators	                'is' 'is not'	Check if two variables refer to same object
# 6. Membership Operators	            'in' 'not in'	Check if a value exists in a sequence
# 7. Bitwise Operators	                `&	^ ~ << >>`

# In modulus % most common statements are used are like if XYZ % 2== 0 which means that if XYZ is divided by 2 and the
# remainder is zero it means that XYZ is a even number. Modulus can be used to check 'multiple of' statements.
